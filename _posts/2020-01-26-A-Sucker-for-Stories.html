<p> For as long as I can remember, I have always been overly enthusiastic about quizzing. During my early days, parents around me were notorious for performing an inaccurate comparative study between kids in the neighborhood - quoting how a kid on the block would read the newspaper diligently for an hour or two. I tried my hand at it but it seemed so dull and banal. I would rather laze around the house and wait patiently for my dad to join me after he was done with the newspaper, to hear what he had read. He had his own way of narrating an event and I would wonder, "Why can't the people writing the articles do the same?" He would quiz me about the various characters in the story and I would answer them with childish fervor. I knew I was a sucker for stories. I specifically loved the zinging effect in my brain when my answers and the story came together to culminate into the final climax. <p>
<p> Quizzing in school was a test of one's ability to remember things - questions were one-liners and to the point. It was extremely competitive and honestly quite stressful. Quizzing in college was different - it was more relaxed, seemed like a whodunnit set in Goa - you had the time to relax and sip some beer along the beach. Not knowing an answer was not frowned upon. Rather, there was more emphasis on learning something new. The quizmaster would take the participants and audience on a journey, narrating a beautiful story. The story would end in a question. The story would be drizzled with clues empowering one to deduce the answer. It was a brilliant blend of storytelling, deduction and quizzing. That is when it hit me - this was my dad narrating a story and asking questions all over again. I've been hooked since then. <p>
